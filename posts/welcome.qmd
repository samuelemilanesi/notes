## Introduction

This a Quarto document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

Click the **Code** button in the header to see the full source code of this document.

Here we call the R `summary()` function---the function's output is included immediately below:

```{python}
print("?BABDABSD")
```


## Interactivity

You can also add interactive plots. For example:

```{python}
#| label: fig-temperatures
#| fig-cap: "New Haven Temperatures"
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
x = np.linspace(-10,10,1000)
plt.plot(x,np.sin(x))
plt.show()
```

## Tables

Use the `knitr::kable()` function to print tables as HTML:

```{python}
print(x)
```


## LaTeX Math

You can also include LaTeX math:

$$
P\left(A=2\middle|\frac{A^2}{B}>4\right)
$$
